## Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

This test does same job as T-Test. Only one differences, dataset must not be normal.

```{r}

shapiro.test(cars$dist)

```
Data is not normal.
```{r}
wilcox.test(cars$dist,mu=40)
```
P-Value is greater than 0.05, so Ho is true. Mean of data is equal to 40.
